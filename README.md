### Project Title: "Bluetooth Controlled Car"

## Definition:
A Bluetooth controlled car is an IoT project designed by our team of 3 students. It's a remote-controlled vehicle that operates via a Bluetooth-enabled device like a smartphone. The car features a Bluetooth module receiving commands from the device, processed by a microcontroller. The microcontroller then sends motor control signals to the motor driver, maneuvering the DC motors that drive the car.

## Feasibility Study:
The Bluetooth controlled car serves as an interactive tool for hobbyists and students to delve into electronics, programming, and robotics. It facilitates learning Bluetooth communication, microcontroller programming, and motor control basics.

## Significance:
Bluetooth technology enhances the interaction between car and driver, fostering safer driving practices through features like hands-free calling and audio streaming. It enriches the in-car experience, promoting connectivity while prioritizing road safety.
