### Project Title: "Bluetooth Controlled Car"

## Definition:
A Bluetooth controlled car is an IoT project designed by our team of 3 students. It's a remote-controlled vehicle that operates via a Bluetooth-enabled device like a smartphone. The car features a Bluetooth module receiving commands from the device, processed by a microcontroller. The microcontroller then sends motor control signals to the motor driver, maneuvering the DC motors that drive the car.

## Feasibility Study:
The Bluetooth controlled car serves as an interactive tool for hobbyists and students to delve into electronics, programming, and robotics. It facilitates learning Bluetooth communication, microcontroller programming, and motor control basics.

## Significance:
Bluetooth technology enhances the interaction between car and driver, fostering safer driving practices through features like hands-free calling and audio streaming. It enriches the in-car experience, promoting connectivity while prioritizing road safety.

## ## Objectives and Scope:
The objective of the Bluetooth controlled car project is to leverage IoT technology for various applications, including:

- Providing a platform for learning and experimentation in electronics, programming, and robotics.
- Teaching fundamentals of Bluetooth communication, microcontroller programming, and motor control.
- Enabling easy control via smartphone or Bluetooth-enabled devices.
- Offering entertainment options like racing or obstacle courses.
